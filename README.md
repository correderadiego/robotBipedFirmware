  I would like to acknowledge the contribution of this previous projects which let me to study its code an structure.

 The objectives of this project are :

 - Create a base to further developments.
 - Learn about the biped movement.
 - Create a cheap and expandable robot biped platform

 I have included a folder with the stls that I have used. I made a mixture from the three previous projects. They are included only for reference. Please check the oficial resources from :
